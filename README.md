# Motivation

This project is meant to provide an alternative to githubs current search engine https://github.com/search. Instead of searching for a repository by keyword, you can find a repository that matches your use case or needs. This was inspired by Ought's Elicit(https://elicit.org/) and Alignment Search(https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bGn9ZjeuJCg7HkKBj/introducing-alignmentsearch-an-ai-alignment-informed)
